// TODO: login page's focus nodes don't work

// login page leads to home page where it might just say "search for a pgae"
// and then you press the search button and it opens up a modal ontop of the app
// whihc has the big search bar and you enter in your query


// soooo the login is a state thing. let's use the local storage package i just
// brought in (the one that indeed does have problems with safely saving stuff)
// and we'll use https://pub.dev/packages/provider too, to provide the token
// and be able to notify people when you need to log in again.
//
// but also like you can browse contentapi without logging in. so it's still valid to alskdfjaslkf

// sources
// https://www.mundanecode.com/posts/login-flow-in-flutter/ - it's kinda broken and it uses old navigator patterns
// https://github.com/Trindade7/two_columns/tree/main/lib - it's janky old but it's literally exactly what i want
// https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-animated-responsive-layout#5 - completely bogged down by the part where they add wacky intricate animations. i'm still jamming! i can't add animations yet!
